TODO:
 - Find equation to produce: 'ERROR: Incorrect postfix equation. This should not happen. [ERR506]' If such
   an equation exists. All error producing equations should have already been dealt with by this time.
 - Error message width should be the same or less than the equation. If only a very long variable is entered,
   parts of the error message are missing. Try and add padding to the control panel area
   This could be done by maintaining the additional 20px at the end of the text_in, when it is shifted to the
   answer line


 - Attempt to shift the following code fragment to its own function: 
            if ( fv_pattern.test( stack_token ) == true ) {

                if ( stack_token in user_variables ) {
                    stack_token = user_variables[stack_token]
                        
                } else if ( stack_token in base_variables ) {
                    stack_token = base_variables[stack_token];
                        
                } else {
                    // example equations: ---abc
                    throw new ParseError('ERROR: \'' + stack_token + '\' is an unknown variable. [ERR503]', index_queue[ index_stack[index_stack.length-1] ]);
                }
            }


 - Shift processEquation into process_equation.js, have it return a dict containing an error flag and 
   the result. If error_flag = 0, then result is the answer (or is an empty array, if answer is suppressed).
   Otherwise error_flag = 1, then the result is error message. The error would also need the array
   containing the equation parts that errored.


 - Make horizontal scrollbar shift in an intuitive manner with respect to the cursor/carat
     - This will likely be done in update_textin()
     - Using arrow keys, home and end respond far too slowly
         - Make the custom event in keydown handle shift+arrow keys
         - side_buffering doesn't handle selection using shift+arrow keys
         - side_buffering doesn't handle selection by click and drag
         - side_buffering doesn't handle caret movement by arrow keys, or the home and end keys
     - clean up side buffering
     
       // This is in keyup, but is presently commented out. It responds too slowly for arrow key presses
       switch (event.which) {
           // an empty case drops down to the next case
           case 35: // end
           case 36: // home
           case 37: // left arrow
           case 38: // up arrow
           case 39: // right arrow
           case 40: side_buffering(); // down arrow
       }


 - Add a clear variable

Major Tasks

 - Pretty up GUI

 - Flash corresponding opening parenthesis, bracket or brace when a close bracket is entered
   If there is no open parenthesis, then highlight the close parenthesis
   Highlight unknown functions or variables unless they are being assigned

 - Expand equation processing to include:
    - vectors and matrices
    - clearing screen
    - deleting variables
    - suppressing output
